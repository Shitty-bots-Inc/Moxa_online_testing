# Moxa
Offical repository for Moxa: A deep learning based approach for unmaned mask detection for prevention of the spread of COVID 19

## Setting up the Enviornment:
 Go to your google drive and do the following:
 1) Create a directory named ```moxa```
 2) In that directory upload the ```moxa.cfg``` , ```obj.names``` and ```obj.data``` given in this repository
   * Download each of these files by clicking on ```raw``` and then ```save as``` by right clicking

   * make sure once you upload the file their names are _exactly the same as mentioned here_
 3) Download the ```moxa.weights``` file from the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1efFfnEiuXWwuGT0465Le0rMEN4g4Mr24
 4) Upload the ```moxa.weights``` in the ```moxa``` directory of google drive
## Live testing:
We will be using google colab platform for live testing of our model
1) click on the following link to open the colab notebook https://github.com/Shitty-bots-Inc/Moxa_online_testing/blob/master/moxa_2_1_HACK_ON.ipynb
2) open the note book with *google colab*

3) Sign in to google account if not already done
4) Run the cells one by one as the notebook say!
## If all goes good you should see the detection like this:
